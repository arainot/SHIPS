SHIPS - SPHERE High-contrast Imaging Pipeline for massive Stars
=====================================

Introduction
-------------

SHIPS is a high-contrast imaging pipeline specialising in the study of massive stars. It includes all necessary routines to fully analyse high-contrast imaging frames taken with SPHERE: it enables the detection and position of potential companion candidates and their spectrum extraction.

SHIPS bridges the gaps between the image processing algorithms from the state-of-the-art software VIP (https://github.com/carlgogo/vip-tutorial) and the scientific user. It aims to be a simple to use reduction pipeling to analyse and process images. 

It is still under active development and is modified daily. Currently at version 1.0.

VIP is a package/pipeline for angular, reference star and spectral
differential imaging for exoplanet/disk detection through high-contrast imaging.
VIP is being developed in Python 3+.
