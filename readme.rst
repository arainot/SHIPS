=====================================

Introduction
-------------

SHIPS is a high-contrast imaging pipeline specialising in the study of massive stars. It includes all necessary routines to fully analyse high-contrast imaging frames taken with SPHERE: it enables the detection and position of potential companion candidates and their spectrum extraction.

SHIPS bridges the gaps between two essential high-contrast imaging codes: VIP<https://github.com/carlgogo/vip-tutorial>  and pyKLIP

VIP is a package/pipeline for angular, reference star and spectral
differential imaging for exoplanet/disk detection through high-contrast imaging.
VIP is being developed in Python 3+.

VIP is being developed within the VORTEX team @ University of Liege (Belgium).
Most of ``VIP``'s functionalities are mature but it doesn't mean it's
free from bugs. The code will continue evolving and therefore all the feedback
and contributions will be greatly appreciated. If you want to report a bug,
suggest or add a functionality please create an issue or send a pull request on
the github repository.
